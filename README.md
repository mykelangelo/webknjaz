### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [ansible/pylibssh](/ansible/pylibssh),
  [ansible/ansible](/ansible/ansible) by day ðŸŒ… and when the sun goes
  down ðŸŒ‡ I do [all sorts of other FOSS things](/sponsors/webknjaz).
  I used to be heavily involved with [ansible/ansible-lint](
  /ansible/ansible-lint) but now I've left it in the hands of [@ssbarnea](
  /sponsors/ssbarnea) â€” please support him in leading the project
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [CPython Internals](
https://realpython.com/products/cpython-internals-book/)
  and [the basics of OpenShift](
  https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/do180-introduction-containers-kubernetes-red-hat-openshift)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on improving the Python ecosystem around
  making GitHub Apps and Actions, packaging, testing, CI/CD
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with getting more hours in a day
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Python packaging, CI/CD, pytest, creating GitHub Apps,
  GitHub Actions, Ansible Collections, CherryPy internals,
  async in Python 3, tox, Gentoo Linux, Git, code reviews, linters,
  maintaining the compatibility with legacy Pythons, dev env, burnouts
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: tweet
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: [he/him](http://pronoun.is/he)
- âš¡ Fun fact: wanting to "fix" a game got me interested in computers
  when I was 7 but when I got older I lost interest in games, worked in
  gaming for just 3 months and never looked back
